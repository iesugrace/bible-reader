The total size of these audio files are about 3.4 GB, not convenient to ship
with the code, so I ignore them from Git.

When you download these files from the web, place them in this directory (the
'audio' directory), each book a directory, the directory name of a book is the
number of that book in the Bible, and the audio files of the chapters are all
named after their chapter numbers. After that, run the script check.sh to ensure
all files are correctly named:

    $ bash check.sh
